# Project Overview: English as Programming Language (ENTRAN)

## Vision Statement

Demonstrate that "English is the new hottest programming language" by creating a web application that treats engineering documents (specifically troubleshooting guides) as executable programs.

## Core Concept

Transform natural language troubleshooting guides into executable programs through a multi-stage compilation process similar to traditional programming languages:

1. **Lexical Analysis & Parsing** - Validate and parse markdown syntax
2. **Transpilation** - Convert to LLM-optimized format with tool definitions
3. **Semantic Analysis** - Extract intent, entities, relationships, and scope
4. **Interpretation** - Execute the "program" with debugger-like controls

## Target Audience

- Engineers who write troubleshooting documentation
- DevOps teams looking to automate diagnostic procedures
- Technical writers interested in executable documentation

## Success Criteria

- Successfully parse and execute a sample troubleshooting guide
- Demonstrate clear visualization of program execution (stack, heap, memory)
- Show practical value in automating diagnostic procedures
- Intuitive UI that feels familiar to developers (debugger-like interface)

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js with Express
- **Frontend**: HTML/CSS/JavaScript (potentially React for better state management)
- **Markdown Processing**: Marked.js or similar
- **LLM Integration**: OpenAI API or similar for natural language understanding
- **UI Components**: Monaco Editor for syntax highlighting, custom debugger interface
