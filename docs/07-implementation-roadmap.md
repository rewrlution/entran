## Risk Assessment and Mitigation

### High Risk Items

1. **LLM Integration Complexity**

   - _Risk_: Complex prompt engineering and API reliability
   - _Mitigation_: Start with rule-based approach, add LLM as enhancement

2. **Real-time Execution Performance**

   - _Risk_: Slow execution affecting user experience
   - _Mitigation_: Implement efficient state management and caching

3. **Tool Execution Security**
   - _Risk_: Security vulnerabilities in command execution
   - _Mitigation_: Use sandboxed simulation instead of real tool execution

### Medium Risk Items

1. **UI Complexity**

   - _Risk_: Complex debugger interface difficult to implement
   - _Mitigation_: Start with basic interface, enhance iteratively

2. **Semantic Analysis Accuracy**
   - _Risk_: Low accuracy in intent recognition
   - _Mitigation_: Use hybrid rule-based and ML approach

### Mitigation Strategies

- **Incremental Development**: Build and test each stage independently
- **Regular Testing**: Continuous integration with automated testing
- **User Feedback**: Early user testing with simple examples
- **Fallback Options**: Graceful degradation when features fail
