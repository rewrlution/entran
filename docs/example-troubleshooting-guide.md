# Example Troubleshooting Guide

## Network Connectivity Troubleshooting

This is a sample troubleshooting guide that demonstrates the ENTRAN system capabilities. It shows how natural language troubleshooting procedures can be treated as executable programs.

### Prerequisites

- Linux system with network interface
- Administrative privileges for network commands
- Basic understanding of network concepts

---

## Check Network Interface Status

First, we need to examine the current state of network interfaces to identify any obvious issues.

1. **Gather interface information**: Run `ip addr show` to display all network interfaces
2. **Analyze interface state**: Look for the interface state in the output (UP/DOWN)
3. **Check specific interface**: If you know the interface name, use `ip addr show eth0`
4. **Identify issues**: Note any interfaces showing DOWN state or missing IP addresses

**If interface is DOWN**: Bring the interface up with `ip link set eth0 up`
**If interface lacks IP**: Configure IP address using `ip addr add 192.168.1.100/24 dev eth0`

_Output: Store the interface status and any corrective actions taken in memory for later reference._

## Verify DNS Resolution

DNS issues are a common cause of connectivity problems. Let's test DNS resolution capability.

1. **Test basic DNS**: Use `nslookup google.com` to test DNS resolution
2. **Try alternative DNS server**: If failed, test with `nslookup google.com 8.8.8.8`
3. **Check DNS configuration**: Examine `/etc/resolv.conf` with `cat /etc/resolv.conf`
4. **Verify DNS server reachability**: Ping the DNS server with `ping 8.8.8.8`

**If DNS fails**:

- Check if `/etc/resolv.conf` contains valid nameserver entries
- Try adding `nameserver 8.8.8.8` to `/etc/resolv.conf`
- Restart network service with `systemctl restart networking`

_Output: Record DNS functionality status and configuration details._

## Test Network Connectivity

Now let's test actual network connectivity to verify data can flow properly.

1. **Ping local gateway**: Use `ip route show` to find gateway, then `ping <gateway_ip>`
2. **Ping external host**: Test with `ping -c 4 8.8.8.8` for basic connectivity
3. **Test specific service**: Try `curl -I https://google.com` to test HTTP connectivity
4. **Check routing table**: Verify routes with `ip route show`

**If ping fails to gateway**:

- Check cable connections
- Verify interface configuration
- Look for conflicting routes

**If external ping fails**:

- Check firewall rules with `iptables -L`
- Verify default route exists
- Test with traceroute: `traceroute 8.8.8.8`

_Set to memory: Overall connectivity status and identified bottlenecks._

## Advanced Diagnostics

For persistent issues, perform deeper network analysis.

1. **Port scanning**: Use `nmap -p 80,443,22 <target_host>` to check specific services
2. **Network traffic analysis**: Monitor with `tcpdump -i eth0 icmp` during ping tests
3. **Check network statistics**: Review with `cat /proc/net/dev` for error counters
4. **Examine system logs**: Look for network errors in `journalctl -u networking`

**For service-specific issues**:

- Check if target ports are open: `telnet <host> <port>`
- Verify local services: `netstat -tlnp`
- Test with different protocols: HTTP vs HTTPS

**For performance issues**:

- Measure bandwidth: `iperf3 -c <server>`
- Check MTU settings: `ip link show eth0`
- Monitor latency: `ping -c 100 <host>` and analyze statistics

_Memory output: Detailed diagnostic results and recommendations for resolution._

## Summary and Recommendations

Based on the troubleshooting results, provide final assessment and next steps.

1. **Review findings**: Summarize the status from each diagnostic step
2. **Identify root cause**: Determine the primary issue based on test results
3. **Recommend actions**: Provide specific steps to resolve identified problems
4. **Document changes**: Record any configuration modifications made

**Common resolutions**:

- Interface configuration issues → Reconfigure network settings
- DNS problems → Update DNS servers or configuration
- Routing issues → Add or modify route table entries
- Firewall blocking → Adjust firewall rules appropriately

_Final memory: Complete diagnostic report with issue analysis and resolution steps._
